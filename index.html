      <h2>Welcome to Baagi</h2>
      <p>Baagi is a not‑for‑profit consulting venture focused on eliminating the abuse of power by state authorities through digitisation and automation of government functions. Our mission is simple: where laws and policies are clear, they should be applied consistently through technology instead of discretionary human whims. By codifying rules and using transparent, auditable algorithms, we promote the rule of law, protect civil liberties and enable fair, predictable governance.</p>
      <p>Explore our site to understand why discretion is a design flaw, learn about our libertarian philosophy, see how we plan to transition to rule‑based governance and discover how you can get involved.</p>
