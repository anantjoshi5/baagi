      </header>
      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Federal Reserve was established in 1913 to prevent financial panics and stabilise the currency. Yet the United States has still experienced severe downturns, banking crises and bouts of high inflation. Libertarians argue that the Fed’s discretionary powers invite politicisation and mismanagement and that better monetary outcomes require clear rules and robust competition.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>The Fed’s track record</h2>
        <p>The Cato Institute observes that some of the nation’s worst economic crises have occurred under the Fed’s watch, including the Great Depression, the stagflation of the late 1970s and early 1980s, and the recent surge of inflation following the COVID‑19 pandemic<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>. Despite these failures, Congress has repeatedly expanded the Fed’s discretion<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>. Such expansion gives central bankers ever greater latitude to experiment and politicise monetary policy, often with costly results.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Rules‑based policy and competition</h2>
        <p>Rather than granting the Fed boundless discretion, libertarians advocate narrowing and clarifying its mandate. Cato suggests that Congress require the Fed to follow a rules‑based monetary policy and remove the dollar’s privileged position so that alternative payment methods can compete<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. Competitive pressure would incentivise the Fed to maintain a stable currency, while clear rules would reduce uncertainty and political meddling.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Responsibilities and neutrality</h2>
        <p>A central bank’s core responsibilities are to ensure that the money supply is sufficient to support economic activity and to avoid creating excess money that fuels inflation. The Fed should not favour particular firms, industries or sectors when conducting policy<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>. A rules‑based approach with a narrow mandate would minimise the Fed’s footprint on economic activity, reducing moral hazard and preventing the transfer of financial risks to taxpayers<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Transparency and accountability</h2>
        <p>For policy to be legitimate, citizens must understand how it is made. Cato notes that the Fed should operate transparently and be accountable to elected representatives<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>. Unfortunately, Fed regimes have become increasingly discretionary since the 1980s, especially after the 2008 financial crisis<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>. By tethering monetary policy to a clear rule and limiting the Fed’s authority, Congress can restore accountability and reduce the risk of future crises.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Monetary stability is vital to prosperity. The Federal Reserve’s century of discretionary management has coincided with major economic upheavals and persistent inflation. Libertarians contend that a return to rules‑based policy—coupled with competitive pressure from alternative payment systems—would anchor expectations, discipline policymakers and help prevent the boom‑bust cycles of the past. Reforming the Fed is an essential step toward sound money and a freer economy.</p>
