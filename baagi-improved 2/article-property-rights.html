        <p class="muted">Why secure title deeds and cadastres are foundations of prosperity</p>
      </header>
      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Few elements of a free society are as fundamental as secure property rights. When people are confident that they own what they produce or purchase, they invest in improvements, trade with others and build long‑term wealth. Conversely, ambiguous titles, corrupt registries and arbitrary seizures discourage entrepreneurship and lock people into poverty. Libertarians therefore view property rights not merely as legal abstractions but as preconditions for human flourishing.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Cadastres underpin markets</h2>
        <p>A <em>cadastre</em> is a public record of land ownership. Cadastres give governments the information necessary to tax and clarify ownership, making transactions more efficient. According to research highlighted by the Cato Institute, cadastres underpin the security of ownership and enable land and credit markets to function at a national scale【454579923662340†L196-L205】. By providing clear, enforceable titles, they make it possible to borrow against land, attract investment and prevent disputes.</p>
        <p>The same research finds that moving from no cadastral system to a full cadastre is associated with an immediate 2.86 percentage point increase in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita【454579923662340†L196-L205】. In other words, countries that formalise land records enjoy a substantial boost in prosperity. Even partial reforms, such as improving the accuracy or accessibility of existing land registries, can yield significant gains, but establishing comprehensive cadastres delivers the largest impact.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Why property rights matter</h2>
        <p>The mechanism behind this relationship is straightforward. When property rights are insecure or ill‑defined, individuals cannot reliably use land as collateral or invest in long‑term projects. Entrepreneurs have less incentive to build factories or plant orchards if they fear that their land may be expropriated or disputed. Clear records reduce these risks and encourage productive use of resources. Libertarians argue that defining property rights allows people to cooperate peacefully and allocate resources more efficiently.</p>
        <p>Although researchers caution that other reforms often accompany cadastral improvements【454579923662340†L207-L214】, the overall evidence supports the libertarian claim that securing property rights enhances economic growth【454579923662340†L213-L214】. In short, prosperity is not possible without a legal framework that recognises and protects ownership.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Secure and transparent land registries are more than bureaucratic niceties; they are engines of progress. By formalising ownership and making titles tradable, cadastres unleash investment and innovation. Policymakers should prioritise legal reforms that clarify property rights and digitise land records, thereby laying the groundwork for entrepreneurship and wealth creation. Baagi’s mission aligns with these principles: we advocate for rule‑based governance that empowers communities, protects property and unlocks economic potential.</p>
