        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>A central bank digital currency (CBDC) is often described as a modern payments innovation. In truth, a CBDC would fundamentally change the relationship between citizens and the state. By placing every transaction on a government‑controlled ledger, it would give officials unprecedented access to people’s financial lives. The Cato Institute warns that such a system could spell doom for what little financial privacy remains.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>The dystopian scenario</h2>
        <p>Imagine a world where every purchase, donation or salary payment is tracked by government officials. The Cato article <em>CBDC Spells Doom for Financial Privacy</em> describes how a CBDC would store all financial activity on a central ledger controlled by the government【65782767882538†L192-L215】. Financial activity could be frozen at a bureaucrat’s whim, and an omnipresent surveillance state would loom over every interaction【65782767882538†L192-L215】. Lawmakers have already eroded privacy through the Bank Secrecy Act, Patriot Act and other statutes; a CBDC would close the remaining “air gap” that currently separates government from private financial records.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Existing surveillance and costs</h2>
        <p>The surveillance regime underlying a potential CBDC is already vast. In 2022 alone, financial institutions filed over 26 million Bank Secrecy Act reports on Americans. Complying with these requirements cost U.S. financial institutions an estimated $45.9 billion, and most reports were triggered by transactions over $10,000【65782767882538†L296-L305】. Because the $10,000 reporting threshold has never been adjusted for inflation, an ever‑growing share of ordinary transactions are swept up【65782767882538†L296-L305】. A CBDC would magnify these problems by making every transaction subject to government monitoring by default.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Why a CBDC isn’t the answer</h2>
        <p>Proponents argue that a CBDC would modernise payments and help the unbanked. But real reforms should focus on expanding private innovation and scaling back surveillance laws. The Cato Institute points out that current privacy protections are already weak【65782767882538†L192-L215】. Instead of creating a digital currency controlled by the central bank, policymakers should repeal antiquated reporting rules, raise reporting thresholds and allow competition in payments. A free society should not condition participation in the economy on government approval.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Financial privacy is a cornerstone of individual liberty. A CBDC would expand the federal government’s reach into our personal lives and cement a surveillance regime that is already excessive. By opposing the creation of a CBDC and instead reforming existing laws, Americans can protect both innovation and privacy.</p>
