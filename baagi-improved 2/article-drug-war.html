        <h1>The Costs of the War on Drugs</h1>
        <p class="muted">Why prohibition harms lives, liberties and public finances</p>
      </header>
      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>More than half a century after President Richard Nixon declared a “war on drugs,” illicit markets thrive, overdose deaths soar and prisons overflow. The federal government spends tens of billions of dollars each year enforcing prohibition, yet drugs remain widely available and more potent than ever. Libertarians argue that criminalising adult drug use violates individual liberty, misallocates resources and exacerbates the very harms it purports to prevent.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Human and economic toll</h2>
        <p>The Cato Institute calls the drug war one of the worst and most counterproductive policies in American history. Between May 2020 and April 2021, more than 100,000 Americans died from drug overdoses—more than gun and automobile deaths combined【433424768901024†L185-L190】. The financial cost is staggering: federal spending on the drug war has exceeded $1 trillion, and the human cost is incalculable—lost lives, families torn apart, inner‑city violence, the militarisation of police and a breakdown of trust between citizens and government【433424768901024†L185-L195】.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Perverse incentives and violence</h2>
        <p>Prohibition fuels black markets where disputes are resolved with violence rather than contracts. Because smugglers seek to evade detection, they transport highly concentrated substances. As Cato notes, this incentive to maximise potency has encouraged the black market distribution of fentanyl, now the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18–45【433424768901024†L203-L207】. Much of the gang violence plaguing communities stems not from the mind‑altering effects of drugs but from the prohibition‑induced struggle for market share【433424768901024†L294-L299】.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Constitutional and federalist concerns</h2>
        <p>Federal drug prohibition is an anomaly in a nation founded on limited, enumerated powers. The Constitution grants Congress no authority to regulate what adults consume. Cato points out that before alcohol prohibition, states set their own policies, and after repeal they again adopted diverse approaches【433424768901024†L210-L223】. Yet the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 imposed a one‑size‑fits‑all regime without a constitutional amendment. Libertarians argue that drug policy should be returned to the states and that Congress should respect state initiatives to legalise or decriminalise various substances.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Misallocation of law enforcement resources</h2>
        <p>Prohibition diverts police away from protecting people and property. Cato notes that addicts commit crimes to fund habits that would be affordable if drugs were legal; because contracts cannot be enforced, disputes turn violent【433424768901024†L286-L303】. Meanwhile, law enforcement agencies devote enormous resources to chasing growers and suppliers. The Drug Enforcement Administration alone employs about 10,000 agents and support staff【433424768901024†L300-L307】, and the federal drug war budget ballooned from roughly $1 billion in 1981 to $40.4 billion in 2021【433424768901024†L309-L312】. For libertarians, this is a classic example of throwing money at a problem while ignoring the underlying cause.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>A path to reform</h2>
        <p>Ending the drug war does not mean endorsing drug use. It means recognising that prohibition creates more harm than it prevents. Cato scholars recommend repealing the Controlled Substances Act and, failing that, removing marijuana and other low‑risk substances from the federal schedules【433424768901024†L145-L170】. They urge Congress to respect state experiments, pardon non‑violent offenders and expunge records for past marijuana crimes【433424768901024†L172-L183】. By treating substance abuse as a health issue rather than a criminal one, society can reduce overdoses, violence and incarceration while restoring constitutional limits on federal power.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The war on drugs has failed by every conceivable metric. It has cost lives, eroded civil liberties, diverted scarce resources and fueled violence. A freer society respects adults’ right to make their own choices and focuses law enforcement on real crimes against people and property. Legalising and regulating currently illicit substances would undercut criminal enterprises, improve safety and allow resources to be redirected to treatment and education. Baagi supports evidence‑based policies that expand liberty and reduce harm, and ending the drug war is essential to that mission.</p>
