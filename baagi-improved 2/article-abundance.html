        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The “abundance agenda” has become a rallying cry for policymakers who want to tackle America’s biggest self‑inflicted wound: we don’t build enough. Advocates rightly call for cutting red tape, streamlining permits, reforming zoning and removing bottlenecks that limit the supply of housing, energy and innovation【875775932873763†L139-L144】. Yet as Cato scholars Veronique de Rugy and Adam Michel argue, this movement has a critical blind spot: tax policy【875775932873763†L146-L149】.</p>

        <h2>The tax code as a barrier</h2>
        <p>Even if a developer survives the permitting maze, she may abandon a project if the after‑tax return does not justify the risk. Today’s tax code and enormous federal deficit punish investment. Corporate earnings are taxed once at the corporate level, again on dividends and capital gains and even at death【875775932873763†L162-L165】. Inflation quietly raises the tax burden on savings and investment, boosting effective tax rates and discouraging entrepreneurs【875775932873763†L162-L169】. Under current rules, businesses must spread deductions for research, development and equipment over years rather than deducting them immediately【875775932873763†L169-L174】. Such policies erode domestic investment and drive capital away from the sectors that abundance advocates want to expand.</p>

        <h2>Evidence from research and experience</h2>
        <p>Empirical studies confirm that corporate income taxes are among the most harmful to economic growth【875775932873763†L182-L185】. The International Monetary Fund finds that foreign direct investment is highly sensitive to tax rates, and research by the former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers shows that tax increases reduce growth by two to three times the revenue they raise【875775932873763†L182-L189】. Conversely, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered corporate taxes and allowed full expensing of capital investments, spurred significant increases in business investment【875775932873763†L191-L194】.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Cutting red tape is necessary but not sufficient to achieve abundance. To unlock investment and innovation, policymakers must pair deregulation with sweeping tax reform: lower rates on investment, allow immediate expensing of capital outlays and simplify the tax base. Without this fiscal overhaul, the abundance agenda will remain a slogan rather than a strategy.</p>
