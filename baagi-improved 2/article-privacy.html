      </header>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Many Americans believe that their financial records are private, protected by the Fourth Amendment. In reality, Congress has been eroding financial privacy for more than half a century. The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 deputized banks as surveillance agents, requiring them to collect and report customers’ transaction information. Over the decades, that regime has expanded, creating an enormous database of Americans’ financial lives.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>The scope of surveillance</h2>
        <p>The Cato Institute notes that financial privacy has been disappearing for over 50 years; much of the surveillance remains hidden in the weeds of old and complex policies【111270673819618†L164-L179】. The Bank Secrecy Act forces financial institutions to record and report customers’ transactions, essentially deputizing them as law‑enforcement investigators【111270673819618†L184-L205】. Institutions must file currency transaction reports whenever a transaction exceeds $10,000 and suspicious activity reports whenever they deem a transaction unusual【111270673819618†L194-L200】. Due to inflation, the $10,000 threshold—set in the 1970s—would be roughly $75,000 today【111270673819618†L204-L207】, meaning that far more ordinary transactions trigger reporting.</p>
        <p>As a result, more than 27 million Bank Secrecy Act reports were filed with FinCEN in 2023【111270673819618†L213-L218】. Yet these reports led to only a few hundred investigations. The system sweeps up massive amounts of innocent data while providing scant benefits to law enforcement. Unsurprisingly, public opinion is turning against this surveillance. A Cato poll found that 79 percent of Americans believe it is unreasonable for banks to share their financial records with the federal government【111270673819618†L231-L240】.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Policy reforms</h2>
        <p>Restoring financial privacy does not require sacrificing legitimate law‑enforcement objectives. The Cato report proposes several reforms: repeal or radically revise the Bank Secrecy Act; adjust reporting thresholds for inflation; eliminate the numerous exceptions in the Right to Financial Privacy Act; require FinCEN to publicly report how many suspicious activity reports actually lead to prosecutions; and require warrants based on probable cause before law‑enforcement agencies may access personal financial records【111270673819618†L249-L266】. In other words, Congress should restore the balance envisioned by the Fourth Amendment, ensuring that data collection is targeted, transparent and subject to judicial oversight.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Financial privacy is an essential pillar of personal liberty. The Bank Secrecy Act has turned banks into spies and created a vast database of citizens’ financial activities. After five decades of expansion, it’s time to restore constitutional protections. By repealing onerous reporting requirements, raising thresholds and demanding judicial warrants, lawmakers can ensure that law enforcement targets real criminals without treating every citizen as a suspect.</p>
