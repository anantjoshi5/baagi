      <h2>Policy and Legal Analysis</h2>
      <p>We analyse laws, regulations and administrative procedures to identify areas where discretionary power leads to inconsistent outcomes. Our team translates legal provisions into clear decision criteria and recommends reforms to eliminate ambiguity. We also assess potential legal risks of automation and ensure compliance with human rights and data‑protection standards.</p>

      <h2>Rule‑Based System Design</h2>
      <p>Baagi designs and prototypes rule‑based decision tools tailored to specific government processes. This includes building decision trees, smart contracts and simple machine‑learning models that apply defined criteria without bias. We work closely with officials to ensure the tools reflect the law accurately and can be audited.</p>

      <h2>Capacity Building</h2>
      <p>Successful adoption of digital governance requires skills and confidence. We provide training programmes for civil servants on digital literacy, algorithmic accountability and data ethics. These sessions demystify AI, explain how algorithms reach conclusions and teach officials how to oversee automated processes.</p>

      <h2>Accountability and Audit Mechanisms</h2>
      <p>Automation without oversight can undermine trust. We help design appeals processes, independent audit mechanisms and transparency dashboards. These components ensure that every automated decision is traceable, explainable and open to challenge by citizens or regulators.</p>
