      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>India’s post‑independence economy was once described as a “Permit Raj” – a labyrinth of licences and approvals governing everything from opening a business to installing a water connection. While many controls have been dismantled since the 1990s, citizens still face a thicket of permits and registrations. Each step requires an official’s signature, and with signature comes discretion. Instead of serving the public, opaque rules create opportunities for rent‑seeking and delay.</p>

      <h2>The Scale of the Problem</h2>
      <p>A 2016 U4 Expert Answer compiled by Transparency International paints a stark picture. Among Indians who had contact with the police, 62&nbsp;% reported paying bribes. When dealing with registry and permit services, 61&nbsp;% of individuals paid bribes, and 58&nbsp;% paid bribes to access land services.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> These figures are not minor irritations; they reveal a systemic dependence on informal payments to navigate everyday government interactions.</p>
      <p>Enterprise surveys by the World Bank cited in the same report show that 19.6&nbsp;% of Indian firms were asked for informal payments to access services and that over half of firms seeking electricity or water connections had to pay bribes.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Such costs are effectively a tax on entrepreneurship and ordinary life. They disproportionately hurt those without connections or resources.</p>

      <h2>Why Discretion Leads to Corruption</h2>
      <p>Discretion means that an official decides whether your application is “complete” or “compliant”. In theory, this allows flexibility for unusual cases. In practice, vague standards allow gatekeepers to slow or speed up the process depending on whether a bribe is offered. Because there is little transparency, citizens cannot predict outcomes or challenge unfair denials. The United Nations notes that the rule of law requires laws to be publicly promulgated, equally enforced and independently adjudicated, with avoidance of arbitrariness.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Discretion violates these principles by making outcomes depend on who you know rather than what the law says.</p>
      <p>Complex procedures also create incentives for “agents” who navigate the bureaucracy for a fee. These intermediaries often cultivate relationships with officials, further entrenching a grey market of influence. Ordinary citizens lose trust, and honest officials find themselves under pressure to conform to corrupt norms.</p>

      <h2>A Rule‑Based Alternative</h2>
      <p>The solution is not to abolish regulations but to make them clear, finite and digital. Governments should publish step‑by‑step criteria for each permit and translate them into decision trees that software can execute. Applicants who meet the criteria should receive immediate approval; those who don’t should receive a reasoned denial. At every stage, the system should log which rule triggered the outcome. When rules change, the public record should be updated.</p>
      <p>By removing discretionary bottlenecks, digital permit systems reduce opportunities for bribery. Officials still play a role in drafting and refining rules, handling exceptions and auditing the system’s performance. Over time, data from automated decisions can inform policy reform: if many applicants fail at a particular step, perhaps the underlying rule is unfair or outdated. Rule‑based automation thus improves both service delivery and law‑making.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Discretion in the provision of permits and services is not a necessary evil but a design flaw. Evidence from Transparency International shows how it leads to widespread bribery and undermines trust. By embracing clear rules, publishing them and enforcing them through transparent digital processes, governments can dismantle the permit raj once and for all. Baagi stands ready to help design and implement these reforms.</p>
